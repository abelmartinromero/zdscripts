Zendesk Scripts
===========

These are some Scripts I personally created and may be useful. Please bear in mind that these are **not official Scripts**. You are free to use/copy them but please do it at your own risk. There is nothing special to do in order to run them.

1. Replace variables needed with your values
2. Log in into your Zendesk. (I use chrome)
3. Open the Developer Tools.
4. Paste the code in the console and press enter.
5. Profit.

This is a quick and simple way to perform actions, bear in mind that some scripts not correctly configured may mess it up. As I mentioned above `use at your own risk`. I'm just here to share the fun :)
